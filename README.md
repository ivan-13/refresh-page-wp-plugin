# WordPress plugin "Refresh Page after user inactivity"

## To do (wish list):
* I would like to add field so user can define ammount of seconds (or miliseconds in this case) before refresh occures

* add ability to execute "Refresh Page" only on choosen PAGE or POST, not on every page

* do you have any other idea how to improve this plugin?
